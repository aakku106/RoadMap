-----

    1. Start with Python:
Why? Python is beginner-friendly, versatile, and widely used in many fields, including security, networking, web development, and data science. It can also help you with quick scripting and automation tasks, which is useful for both security and cloud-related work. Starting with Python will give you confidence and practical skills to build on.
Learning Strategy: Begin with the basics (syntax, control flow, functions, etc.), then gradually move into networking, scripting, and security-related tasks (e.g., using libraries like socket, scapy, and requests).
2. Move to Swift:
Why? Swift aligns with your interest in Apple technologies and iOS development. Once you have a strong base in Python, diving into Swift will allow you to explore mobile app development, especially if you aim to work with Apple in the future.
Learning Strategy: After getting comfortable with Python, start learning Swift by focusing on iOS app development basics (using Xcode, SwiftUI, etc.). You can build simple apps and gradually tackle more complex projects.
3. Learn Rust:
Why? Rust is an emerging language, particularly valued for its memory safety and performance. It's gaining traction in systems programming, security, and performance-critical applications. By the time you get to Rust, you'll have a solid foundation in Python and Swift, making Rust easier to grasp.
Learning Strategy: Begin with Rust's syntax and unique features (like ownership and borrowing), then move into systems programming or security-related projects. Rustâ€™s complexity makes it better suited for after you've built some programming confidence.
4. Explore Cloud Computing:
Why? Cloud computing is essential in today's tech world, and it complements networking and security skills. You'll benefit from learning cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud after you've developed a solid foundation in programming. Cloud skills are highly valuable in security, software development, and IT roles.
Learning Strategy: Start with free resources from AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, focusing on core services like computing, storage, and networking. Then, explore security, deployment, and automation in the cloud.
Recap of the Learning Order:
Python: Foundation in programming, scripting, and security.
Swift: Mobile app development and Apple technologies.
Rust: System-level programming, security, and performance-critical applications.
Cloud Computing: Networking, security, and cloud services.
